# YouTubeLimiter
YouTube limiter is a tool for parents to prevent children watching YouTube more than 30 min/day.

It runs on Windows, works for Chrome and Edge.
No extentions are needed.

## Usege
Run YouTubeLimiter.exe.

If you open "YouTube" tab on your browser and if it is active, the counter will be decremented.
If you open "YouTube" tab on your browser but the tab is not active, the counter will be kept.

I don't want my 10-year-old kid to be found this useage other than run it.
If you want to change the limit time or terminate it, please look at the code. The answer is there.

## Why the tool needed?
There are some Chrome extentions (such as 'Intention') to do the same thing, but my kid can escape them easily.

## Limitation
This tool is kind of a riddle between me and my kid. Not the tool for adults.
I'm looking forward my kid to solve this restrection in someday.
Then I'll make it more difficult to terminate :)
