# YouTubeLimiter
YouTube limiter is a tool for parents to prevent children watching YouTube more than 30 min.
It runs on Windows, works for Chrome and Edge.
No extentions are needed.

# Usege
Run YouTubeLimiter.exe.
I don't want my 10-year-old kid to be found this useage other than run it.
If you are an adult or smart enaugh, please look at the code. The answer is there.

# Why the tool needed?
There are some Chrome extentions (such as 'Intention') to do the same thing, but my kid escaped them easily.

# Limitation
This tool is kind of a riddle between me and my kid. Not the tool for adults.
I'm looking forward my kid to solve this restrection in someday.
Then I'll make it more difficult to terminate :)
