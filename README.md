# YouTubeLimiter
YouTube limiter is a tool for parents to prevent children watching YouTube more than 30 min/day.

It runs on Windows, works for Chrome and Edge.
No extentions are needed.

## Usege
Run YouTubeLimiter.exe.

If you open "YouTube" tab on your browser and if it is active, the counter will be decremented every 1 minute.
When the counter is 0, the browser will be closed.

If you open "YouTube" tab on your browser but the tab is not active, the counter will remains.

I don't want my kid to be found this useage other than run it.
It should be easy to terminate it for adults:)

## Why the tool is needed?
Because my children are adicted to YouTube.
There are some Chrome extentions (such as 'Intention') to do the same thing, but my children can escape them easily.

## Limitation
This tool is kind of a riddle between me and my child. Not the tool for adults.
I'm looking forward my child to solve this restrection in someday.
Then I'll make it more difficult to terminate :)
